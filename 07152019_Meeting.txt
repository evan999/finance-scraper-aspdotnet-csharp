7/15/19 Meeting

Phase 2

Goal:

Debug Phase 2 and complete ASAP! 

Project slightly behind, but getting back on track. Must troubleshoot bugs and issues with 
Phase 2 deliverables, then move to Phase 3: Front-End (ASP.NET).

Switched back to Console App for the time being. Implementing scraper and database functionality 
will be simpler with less moving parts to submit. Porting code over to ASP.NET application shouldn't 
be too difficult.

Problems to fix:

-Identity bug caused (likely) by the Id PK
-Indexing issues - is all the data being stored?
-Ensure all stock data in the StockList is stored in the database into 11 records.
