7/2/2019 - Meeting

Items completed yesterday:

-Create the Finance database
-Create the table schema, assigning column names and datatypes. 

Possible approaches for database connection to Console App:

-Entity Framework
-Connection string

Chosen method: Entity Framework

This seems like a good place to start, and it may smoothen some of the process 
in connecting the database to the app in order to achieve an MVP on time.


Items to work:

-Research Entity framework
-Create Entity DB Model for Finance database and SQL Server connection
-Connect ADO Entity Object to console app via inheritance.
